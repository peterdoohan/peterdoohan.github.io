🥼 I'm a second year graduate student studying Neuroscience at the University of Oxford.

### My Work
👨‍💻 I work between the [Computational Neuroscience Group](https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/research/computational-neuroscience-group), led by Tim Behrens, and the [Cognitive Circuits Lab](https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/research/cognitive-circuits), led by Thomas Akam. Our work focuses on the neural mechanisms that support flexible goal-directed behaviour. 

🐁 My graduate work aims to understand how the medial frontal cortex supports navigation in complex environments. To do this I collect and analyse single-unit neural acitivty from mice as they navigate around complex grid maze environments.

🌿 In a previous life I studied epilepsy and cannabinoid pharmacology at the [Lambert Initiative for Cannabinoid Therapeutics](https://www.sydney.edu.au/lambert/).
